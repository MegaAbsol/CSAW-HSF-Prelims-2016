In this problem, we are given a seemingly encrypted statement.

It's a low value problem, so it's likely quipqiup.com will work on it. Unfortunately, this was not the case, and further research is required.

In pseudo-reconnaisance problems such as these, the problem title is nearly always important. Additionally, "727" seems important as it is the only non-alphabetical word.

By searching "727 spies cipher", we are able to find the website http://www.mountvernon.org/george-washington/the-revolutionary-war/spying-and-espionage/the-culper-code-book/, which is a very interesting cipher used by spies in the Revolutionary War.

By translating the statement, we get:

`New York uau uuarming uith redcoatu uo uecrecy uau tattamount.`

Evidently, this isn't correct. However, we can reasonably guess the rest of the words, and we get the flag.

flag: `New York was swarming with redcoats so secrecy was tantamount.`
